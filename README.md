# Site-Spot

This project is a simple website generator, where random gaming based, fun based or really cool websites are generated.
There are some useless as well as some useful websites too. 
This project is what people will need when they're bored and all caught up on the internet.
There are some prank sites which student might like to check out.


I liked working on this project as this might not be a unique idea, still i thought of coming up with such a site 
which could sum up all other random website generators, as they all provide a quite limited range of sites to play around, also based on just one theme. And this project provides categorised searching of random website, which I haven't seen before.
While collecting data for this project, i found many interesting websites which didn't receive the appreciation that they deserve.

Try it out. [demo](https://shinigami017.github.io/Site-Spot/index.html)

Work for next version :

* #### More efficient algorithm
This project need a better algorithm for random generation of websites, because somewhere, in each session the pattern of random sites generated looks quite similar.

* #### Better UI
Honestly, the UI work on this project is not so good, just basic styling rules are applied. So, it definitely need a better UI.

###### Any suggestions for these, will be highly appreciated.
