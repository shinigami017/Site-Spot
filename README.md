# Site-Spot

This project is a simple website generator, where random gaming based, fun based or really cool websites are generated.
There are some useless as well as some useful websites too. 
This project is what people will need when they're bored and all caught up on the internet.
There are some prank sites which student might like to check out.


I liked working on this project as this was just my idea, not a unique one, still i thought of coming up with such a site 
which could sum up all other random website generators, as they all provide a quite limited range of sites to play around, also based on just one theme.

Try it out. [demo](https://shinigami017.github.io/Site-Spot/index.html)

If people like this one, then they will be happy to know about the Version2 of this project which will include :
* #### Categories
  Different categories for efficient website generation, as per the need of user.
* #### In-built Frame
  In-built Frame for launching the site, so that user does not have to leave the page for another website.
* #### Upgarded UI
  Upgraded and enhanced UI for making it more user-friendly.
